# Advent of Code 2022 Solutions

Solutions to [the 2022 edition of Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2022).

## About this repository

This year real life is a bit hectic!
My plan is to learn *some* Kotlin with Advent of Code.
But in the first few days I also love to have a shot at the leaderboard.
So this repository will contain a mixture of solutions, probably starting with some JavaScript before moving on to Kotlin.

## Lessons Learned

Here's something I learned for the various days of advent:

1. Too much prep can *hurt*.
2. Straightforward *can* work.
3. Reading comprehension is hard.
4. Programming is a skill *and* a craft.
